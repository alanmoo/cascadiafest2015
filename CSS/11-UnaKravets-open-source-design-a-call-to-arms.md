### Innovation (historically)
- Corporations
- Government funds
- Open Source

**"Open Source is broken"**
Gender and other diversity *improves* outcomes!

We need more Designers involved with Open Source communities, but there are barriers to them entering these groups.

### Fixes
1. Encourage more design into the developer's workflow (teach git!)
2. Foster design participation in open source community (github, feedback)

> Sharing your excitement about code with designers will make them curious.

**C**ommunication: design labels on GitHub 
**A**ccessibility: clear getting started/contributing documentation
**R**espect: 
**E**mpathy: evolutionary tactic

~1.5% of Open Source projects' contributors are women

> Open Source is about people!
